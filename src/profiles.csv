It was a monochromic cassette-based desktop my father brought to replace his typewriter. It was the early 90th, and most of my friend‚Äôs families brought cars for the same price. This has defined my life. By the age of 25, I had commercial experience in C/C++, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. I worked with distributed and high-loaded projects. At 27 I decided to run my own outsourcing company. It started as a company of 3 people and grew up to 20 engineers with offices in Moscow and Prague in 4 years. I had the CTO role, I built the team, applied SDLC processes, communicated with clients to build requirements, and so on. After 6 years I started to see some weaknesses and gaps in my management knowledge which stopped me from getting to the next level, so I decided to take a step back and took a role in a US-based company to obtain some practical knowledge of corporate-style management. Simultaneously I‚Äôve started a broad educational process around IT management (which led me to graduation from the ‚ÄúLeading People and Teams‚Äù specialization of the University of Michigan)."

I love connecting with people and helping them, but I realized that I didn't want to work in sales for the rest of my life, so in 2021 I enrolled in a UX/UI design (+ mobile design) course and completed it with a certificate. I was involved in project work in all cases, my responsibilities included (to varying degrees): search and analysis of competitors, development of CJM and User Flow (in the creation of a mobile application based on iOS), looking for references, creating moodboards, creation of wireframes, rendering of the website interface, their adaptive versions and a mobile application based on iOS in Figma, as well as creating animations (Figma) and preparing an interactive prototype (Figma); creating a UI Kit.Also had experience working with programs like Ps and Ai, but mostly I work in Figma.
